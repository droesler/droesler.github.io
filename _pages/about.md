Hello! I'm David Roesler, a recent graduate of the [University of Washington Computational Linguistics MS program](https://www.compling.uw.edu/). I have interests in natural language processing, machine learning, corpus linguistics, and language education. I am currently seeking an industry position that will allow me to apply and expand my knowledge of NLP and machine learning techniques and algorithms. This portfolio site contains links to some of [my research work](https://droesler.github.io/publications/), [NLP projects](https://droesler.github.io/portfolio/), and [my current CV](https://droesler.github.io/cv/).

In 2020, I completed the [MA TESOL program at Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/applied-linguistics/ma-tesol-portland-state), where I performed corpus research under the supervsion of [Professor Susan Conrad](https://www.pdx.edu/profile/susan-conrad). For my thesis project, I built a 3.5-million-word academic computer science corpus and used distributional statistics to derive [an academic wordlist for English-for-specific purpose educators and material developers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeap.2021.101044).

For the duration of 2022, I worked as a machine learning research intern at the [University of Washington School of Medicine Department of Biomedical Infomatics](https://bime.uw.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Annie Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/atchen/). In this position, I developed and implemented [a substance use stigma detection system for social media data](https://droesler.github.io/publication/2022-12-15-Stigma-Detection) as part of an NIH-funded research project. I designed a system that leveraged contextual embeddings combined with affective, social, and behavioral features to classify instances of substance use stigma in Reddit posts.   

In addition to my work in NLP/ML, I have language teaching experiences include writing workshops for the Portland State University Civil Engineering Department, ESL instruction for professionals and college-bound students in the US, and many years of international EFL instruction.
